# Rubik's Cube Scramble Generator
A simple Python program that generates a sequence of Rubik's Cube moves: Right, Left, Up, Down, Front, Back, and their inverses (designated with an ' character).
- You will need the random module to run this program.
- The default length of the sequence is 25 moves, but you can change that by editing numberOfMoves in line 7.

### Things I could add
- Take user input to determine length of sequence
